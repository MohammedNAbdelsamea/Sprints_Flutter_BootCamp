# Task 2: Categorize Numbers as Even or Odd

## Description
This Dart program categorizes numbers from a list into **Even** or **Odd**. It iterates through the list using a **for-loop** and determines if a number is even or odd using a **switch case**.

## How It Works
1. A list of integers is defined.
2. Each number is processed using a `for` loop.
3. A **switch case** checks:
   - If the number is divisible by 2 (`number % 2 == 0`), it is **Even**.
   - Otherwise, the number is **Odd**.
4. Results are printed to the console.
