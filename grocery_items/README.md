# Task 1: Calculate the Total Cost of Grocery Items

## Description
This Dart program calculates the total cost of grocery items, including a 10% tax rate. It uses:
1. A list of maps to represent grocery items with their names and prices.
2. A `for` loop to iterate over the list and calculate the subtotal.
3. A constant tax rate (`10%`) to calculate the final total after tax.

---

## How It Works
1. Define a **constant tax rate** (`TAX_RATE` = 0.10).
2. Create a list of grocery items as **maps** containing:
   - `name` → the item's name.
   - `price` → the item's price.
3. Use a **for loop** to calculate the total price (subtotal).
4. Add the tax amount to the subtotal to get the final total.
5. Print the results: subtotal, tax amount, and total price.
